"""AutoTrack

Module that contains the functionalities of performing automatic actions with the Solys2.

It exports the following classes:
    * MoonTracker : Object that contains the thread that controls the Solys2 for tracking \
automatically the Moon.
    * SunTracker : Object that contains the thread that controls the Solys2 for tracking \
automatically the Sun.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ip : str

    seconds : float
        Amount of seconds waited between each message of change of position of zenith and azimuth.
    library : _BodyLibrary
        Body library that will be used to track the body. Moon or Sun.
    mutex_cont : Lock
        Mutex that controls the access to the variable cont_track
    cont_track : ContainedBool
        Container for the boolean value that represents if the tracking must stop or if it should
        continue.
    logger : logging.Logger
        Logger that will log out the log messages
    port : int
        Access port. By default 15000.
    password : str
        Ethernet user password. By default is "solys".
    is_finished : ContainedBool
        Container for the boolean value that initially will be False, but it should be changed
        to True when exiting the function.
    altitude : float
        Altitude in meters of the observer point. Used only if SPICE library is selected.
    kernels_path : str
        Directory where the needed SPICE kernels are stored. Used only if SPICE library
        is selected.
    solys_delay : float
        Approximate delay in seconds between telling the Solys2 to move to a position and
        the Solys2 saying that it reached that position.
    inst_callback : Callable
        Function that will be executed synchronously when the Solys points to the body correctly.
        If None nothing will be executed. By default it's None.
    instrument_delay : float
        Approximate time in seconds that the measure instrument takes in each measurement.

    Raises
    ------
