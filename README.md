## Usage

### Direct communication

The solys2 package can be used for communicating direcly with the SOLYS2,
using the Solys2 object from the solys2 module.

A few of the functions contained in said module are used in the following code block:

```python
from solys2 import solys2

# Connect with the Solys2
solys = solys2.Solys2(ip, port, password)

# Tell the Solys2 to point at azimuth 30.
solys.set_azimuth(30)

# Get the current position at which the solys is pointing.
az, ze, _ = solys.get_current_position()

# Send the command "HO" to the Solys2
output = solys.send_command("HO")
# Another option would have been calling solys.home()

# Obtain the status of the Solys, the activated flags and the deactivated flags.
status, act_flags, deact_flags, _ = solys.get_status()
```

### Automatic tracking

The automation module contains modules related with automatic movements of the SOLYS2.

One of this submodules is **autotrack**, which contains the functionalities needed for
tracking either the sun or the moon.

The following code block explains how to track the sun using the module.

```python
from solys2.automation import autotrack

# Track the sun, sending a new position each 15 seconds, and logging the
# information (movements, etc) to a file called "solys.log"
st = autotrack.SunTracker(ip, 15, port, password, True, "solys.log")

# Start tracking
st.start()

# Stop tracking the Sun
st.stop()
```

### Calibration

The automation module is als composed by the module **calibration**, which contains diverse
calibration functions, mainly the performance of Crosses and the performance of Meshes or
Matrices.

#### Cross

A Cross is a calibration technique based on pointing at the position of the body and to a set of
points near to the body position, following a cross shape, where the azimuth and zenith
are the axis of said cross.

A range of offset values is defined for azimuth and for zenith, and the Solys2 starts pointing
to the body position with some offsets equivalent to the previously defined values. At least one
of the axis offsets will always be 0 for all positions.

For example, if the range for both azimuth and zenith goes from -0.5 to 0.5 with a step of size
0.25, the pointed values offset will be: 

[(-0.5, 0), (-0.25, 0), (0, 0), (0.25, 0), (0.5, 0), (0, -0.5), (0, -0.25), (0, 0), (0, 0.25),
(0, 0.5)]

In order to perform the measures, the calibration object can be given a callback that will
be executed when the software calculates that it's the moment to measure the body. It should also
be given the parameter "instrument_delay", which represents the amount of time that the
instrument takes in order to perform one measure.

Other option is to give the CalibrationParemeter a non-zero countdown value, and a logger that
logs out level info messages, and it will log out a countdown from that initial value to zero,
and everytime it reaches zero the measure should be started manually.

After performing the Cross one could know which azimuth and zenith adjustments are necessary
for the Solys2 to point exactly at the selected celestial body.

The following code block performs a cross over the moon using the aforementioned object:

```python
from solys2.automation import calibration as cali
from solys2.automation import positioncalc as psc
from solys2 import common

cp = cali.CalibrationParameters(-1, 1, 0.1, -1, 1, 0.1, 5, 1)
logger = common.create_default_logger(logging.DEBUG)
library=psc.MoonLibrary.EPHEM_MOON
lc = cali.LunarCross(TCP_IP, cp, library, logger)
lc.start()
```

Now, instead of having to take the measures manually, the following code block uses a
given callback "measure()":

```python
from solys2.automation import calibration as cali
from solys2.automation import positioncalc as psc
from solys2 import common

cp = cali.CalibrationParameters(-1, 1, 0.1, -1, 1, 0.1, 2, 0)
logger = common.create_default_logger(logging.DEBUG)
library=psc.MoonLibrary.EPHEM_MOON
lc = cali.LunarCross(TCP_IP, cp, library, logger, inst_callback=measure)
lc.start()
```

#### Mesh / Matrix

The Mesh or Matrix is a technique very similar to the Cross, but instead of only obtaining
the measures of the vertical and horizontal axis, it obtains the measures for all the
matrix.

The following code block performs a cross over the sun using the calibration object:

```python
from solys2.automation import calibration as cali
from solys2.automation import positioncalc as psc
from solys2 import common

cp = cali.CalibrationParameters(-1, 1, 0.1, -1, 1, 0.1, 5, 1)
logger = common.create_default_logger(logging.DEBUG)
library=psc.SunLibrary.PYSOLAR
sc = cali.SolarCross(TCP_IP, cp, library, logger)
sc.start()
```

### Position libraries

In the automation module the user can choose which library/package to use in the calculations of the selected
body's data.

These libraries are contained in the submodule automation.positioncalc (internally aliased as psc), and
they are the following:

For the Sun:
- **spicedsun**: Library that uses NASA's data. The most exact one, but requires the presence of kernels files.
- **pysolar**: Library that is very close to the correct data from SPICE, and doesn't require the presence of extra
files. This is the default one. The errors are related to the sunrise and sunset.
- **ephem**: Library that is also close to the correct data from SPICE, but not as much as pysolar. The errors
are related to the sunrise and sunset.


For the Moon:
- **spicedmoon**: Library that uses NASA's data. The most exact one, but requires the presence of kernels files.
- **ephem**: Library that is very close to the correct data from SPICE, and doesn't require the presence of extra
files. This is the default one, although the error might be too big for some users.
- **pylunar**: Library that is very incorrect for some punctual data. Usage not recommended.

#### SPICE

SPICE is a toolkit created by the NASA's team NAIF, which contains a lot of functionalities that
help in the calculations of spatial data. The SPICE toolkit has been used in two
python libraries for the calculation of solar and lunar data: spicedsun and spicedmoon
respectively.

In order to use the SPICE libraries, a directory with all the kernels must be specified.

That directory must contain the following kernels:

## Structure

The package is composed of different modules:
- **connection**: Module that encapsulates and abstracts functions that allow the low-level communication
with the Solys2.
- **response**: Module that contains functionalities for processing the Solys2 responses.
- **solys2**: Module that encapsulates and abstracts an interface for interacting with the Solys2.
- **positioncalc**: Module that contains the objects that allow the calculation of the position of the moon
and the sun using different libraries, like ephem, pysolar or SPICE (spicedmoon and spicedsun).
- **common**: Module containing common constants, functions and datatypes.
- **autohelper**: Module that contains the functionalities that are used for performing automatic actions
with the Solys2.
- **autotrack**: Module that contains the functionalities of performing automatic actions with the Solys2.
- **calibration**: This module contains the functionalities related to different calibration methods,
most of them used by the GOA-UVa.

The main modules that can be used are the module **solys2**, which allowes the user to interact
with the SOLYS2 easily, and **autotrack** and **calibration**, which let the user perform automated
functions like tracking the moon or performing a calibration cross over the moon.
